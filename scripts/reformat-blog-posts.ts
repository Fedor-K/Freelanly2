## Before the Interview

### Technical Setup

Your tech setup can make or break your interview. Test everything beforehand.

**Essential checklist:**

- [ ] Stable internet connection (wired if possible)
- [ ] Working webcam and microphone
- [ ] Quiet, well-lit space
- [ ] Professional background
- [ ] Backup device ready

> **Pro tip:** Do a test call with a friend 24 hours before your interview.

### Research the Company

Go beyond the "About Us" page:

1. Read recent news and press releases
2. Check their engineering blog
3. Look up your interviewers on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)
4. Understand their tech stack
5. Know their competitors

### Prepare Your Stories

Use the **STAR method** for behavioral questions:

- **S**ituation — Set the context
- **T**ask — Explain your responsibility
- **A**ction — Describe what you did
- **R**esult — Share the outcome (with metrics)

---

## During the Interview

### First Impressions

The first 30 seconds matter:

1. Join 2-3 minutes early
2. Smile and make "eye contact" (look at the camera)
3. Have a confident, clear greeting ready
4. Show enthusiasm for the role

### Communication Tips

Remote interviews require extra clarity:

- **Speak slightly slower** than normal
- **Pause** before answering complex questions
- **Confirm understanding** before diving into answers
- **Use screen share** when explaining technical concepts

### Technical Interviews

For coding interviews:

1. **Think out loud** — Explain your thought process
2. **Ask clarifying questions** — Don't assume
3. **Start simple** — Get a working solution first
4. **Optimize later** — Mention improvements you'd make
5. **Test your code** — Walk through edge cases

> **Remember:** Interviewers care more about your problem-solving approach than getting the perfect answer.

Practice on platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), or [Codility](https://www.codility.com/).
